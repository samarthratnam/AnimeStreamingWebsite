A while back, I started learning HTML and CSS and some basic JavaScript through my college's web development club & through YouTube, specifically from the Apna College channel. Recently, our Web Development Club assigned us a project, and I decided to put my knowledge to the test by creating an Anime Streaming Website Landing Page.

Initially, it started as a Crunchyroll clone, but with minimal assistance from ChatGPT, I built the project from scratch, applying what I learned and refining my skills along the way. This experience not only strengthened my understanding of web development but also boosted my confidence in creating projects independently.
Excited to keep learning and building more! ðŸš€
